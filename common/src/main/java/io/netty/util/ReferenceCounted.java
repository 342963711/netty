 * A reference-counted object that requires explicit deallocation.
 * 需要显示释放的引用计数对象
 * <p>
 * When a new {@link ReferenceCounted} is instantiated, it starts with the reference count of {@code 1}.
 * {@link #retain()} increases the reference count, and {@link #release()} decreases the reference count.
 * If the reference count is decreased to {@code 0}, the object will be deallocated explicitly, and accessing
 * the deallocated object will usually result in an access violation.
 * </p>
 * 实例化一个新的 ReferenceCounted，它以引用计数1开始的，通过retain 来进行应用增加，release引用计数减少。当应用计数到0时，对象将被显示释放。
 * 访问一个释放的对象一般将会出现访问冲突
 * <p>
 * If an object that implements {@link ReferenceCounted} is a container of other objects that implement
 * {@link ReferenceCounted}, the contained objects will also be released via {@link #release()} when the container's
 * reference count becomes 0.

 * 如果实现了ReferenceCounted 是一个包含其他实现了ReferenceCounted 对象的容器。 当容器的引用计数为0的时候，它包含的对象也将通过release()来进行释放
